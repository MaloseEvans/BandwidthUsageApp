# Bandwidth_Usage
This project aims to develop a standalone software application using Python that measure and categorizes network bandwidth usage across various services and applications on a host machine.. The primary objective is to provide end-users with clear, actionable insights into where their network data is being consumed.

Display all the processes that use data connection, sent and received per PID/Application
This requires administrators priviledges
